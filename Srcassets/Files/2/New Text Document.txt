Wikitext, also known as wiki markup or wikicode, is the markup language used by the MediaWiki software to format pages. (Note the use of lowercase spelling for these terms.)[a]

To learn how to view and edit wikitext, and how to save changes, see Help:Editing. In most cases, markup can be copied and pasted without the need to write new code. A quick reference guide is available at Help:Cheatsheet.

In addition to wikitext, some HTML elements are also permitted for presentation formatting. For more details, see Help:HTML in wikitext.

Layout
Sections
Article sections in a page will follow that page's lead or introduction and, if there are four or more, the table of contents.

Section headings
Further information: Help:Section and Wikipedia:Manual of Style § Section headings
The = through ====== markup are headings for the sections with which they are associated.

A single = is styled as the article title and should not be used within an article.
Headings are styled through CSS and add an [edit] link. See this section for the relevant CSS.
Four or more headings cause a table of contents to be generated automatically.
Do not use any markup after the final heading markup – this will either break the heading, or will cause the heading to not be included in an edit summary.


Markup	Renders as
= Heading 1 =
== Heading 2 ==
=== Heading 3 ===
==== Heading 4 ====
===== Heading 5 =====
====== Heading 6 ======
Heading 1
Heading 2
Heading 3
Heading 4
Heading 5
Heading 6

Templates: {{fake heading}} for use in documentation.

Horizontal rule
Further information: MOS:HR
The horizontal rule represents a paragraph-level thematic break. Do not use in article content, as rules are used only after main sections, and this is automatic.

Markup	Renders as
----

The four hyphens must appear at the beginning of a line.

The HTML equivalent is <hr />, which can be indented if required. (---- always starts at the left margin.)

The template {{Hr}} produces a similar rule but allows the thickness to be specified.

Table of contents
Further information: H:TOC
When a page has at least four headings, a table of contents (TOC) will automatically appear after the lead and before the first heading. The TOC can be controlled by magic words or templates:

__FORCETOC__ forces the TOC to appear at the normal location regardless of the number of headings.
__TOC__ forces the TOC to appear at the point where the magic word is inserted instead of the normal location.
__NOTOC__ disables the TOC entirely.
{{TOC limit}} template can be used to control the depth of subsections included in the TOC. This is useful where the TOC is long and unwieldy.
Category:Wikipedia table of contents templates contains a number of specialized TOC templates.
Line breaks
Further information: Help:Line-break handling, Wikipedia:Line breaks usage, and Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Accessibility § Indentation
Line breaks or newlines are used to add whitespace between lines, such as separating paragraphs.

A line break that is visible in the content is inserted by pressing ↵ Enter twice.
Pressing ↵ Enter once will place a line break in the markup, but it will not show in the rendered content, except when using list markup.
Markup such as bold or italics will be terminated at a line break.
Blank lines within indented wikitext should not be added, to avoid creating accessibility issues.
Markup	Renders as
A single newline here
has no effect on the layout.

But an empty line starts a new paragraph, 
or ends a list or an indented part.
A single newline here has no effect on the layout.

But an empty line starts a new paragraph, or ends a list or an indented part.

HTML equivalent: <br> or <br /> can be used to break line layout.

Templates for line breaks:

{{break}} can add multiple line breaks.
{{-}} and {{clear}} adds a break with styling, to clear floating elements. Often used to prevent text from flowing next to unrelated tables or images.
Unbulleted list:

{{plainlist}} and {{unbulleted list}} both create an unbulleted list.
Indent text
Further information: WP:INDENT and Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Accessibility § Indentation
Indentation is most commonly used on talk pages.

Markup	Renders as
Indentation as used on talk pages:
:Each colon at the start of a line
::causes the line to be indented by three more character positions.
:::(The indentation persists
so long as no carriage return or line break is used.)
:::Repeat the indentation at any line break.
::::Use an extra colon for each response.
:::::And so forth ...
::::::And so on ...
{{Outdent|::::::}}The outdent template can give a visual indicator that we're deliberately cancelling the indent (6 levels here)

Templates: {{outdent}}, {{outdent2}}

Blockquote
When there is a need for separating a block of text. This is useful for (as the name says) inserting blocks of quoted (and cited) text.

Markup	Renders as
Normal text
<blockquote>
The '''blockquote''' tag will indent both margins when needed instead of the left margin only as the colon does.
</blockquote>
Normal text
Normal text

The blockquote tag will indent both margins when needed instead of the left margin only as the colon does.

Normal text

This uses an HTML tag; template {{quote}} results in the same render.

Center text
See also: div and span, HTML tag, and Template:Align
Markup	Renders as
<div class="center" style="width: auto; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">Centered text</div>
Centered text
Template {{center}} uses the same markup. To center a table, see Help:Table#Centering tables. Please do not use <center>...</center> tags, as it is obsolete.

Align text to right
You can align content in a separate container:

Markup	Renders as
<div style="text-align: right; direction: ltr; margin-left: 1em;">Text on the right</div>
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat.
Text on the right
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat.
Or; make the text float around it:

Markup	Renders as
<div class="floatright">Text on the right</div>
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat.Text on the rightLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat.
{{stack|Text on the right}}
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat.

Lists
Further information: Help:List and MOS:LIST
Do not leave blank lines between items in a list unless there is a reason to do so, since this causes the MediaWiki software to interpret each item as beginning a new list.

Unordered lists

Markup	Renders as

*** Sub-item 4 a) 1.
**** Sub-item 4 a) 1. i)
